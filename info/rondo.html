    <h2>The Brothers of Rondo Documentary</h2>

    <section class="container">
        <div>
            <p>I was asked to create a poster, banner, and storyboard illustrations for the film, <em><a href="https://vimeo.com/1013963678/26309d4b0e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Brothers of Rondo.</a></em> The film was directed by Francis Sampah and hosted by Minnesota Historical Society.</p>
            
            <p>The film chronicles the life stories of four men -- Lewis Scott, Russel T. Balenger, Readus W. Fletcher, Carl Griffin -- who grew up in the Rondo neighborhood of Saint Paul, enrolled at Minnesota State University Moorhead, and went on to become leaders in their respective areas of work and study. Their stories demonstrate the importance of Black culture and community, and how the Rondo neighborhood -- and its destruction for the construction of I-94 -- were instrumental in laying a foundation of resilience in their lives. In the face of displacement, racism and economic adversity, the Brothers channeled lessons learned in Rondo to make a profound impact in their careers, communities, and the state of Minnesota.</p>

            <p>I also created a retractable banner for events. The design is a longer version of the poster. I changed a few visual elements to accommodate for the expanded size.</p>
