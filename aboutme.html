            <h3>My name is Jocelyn</h3>
            <p>Iâ€™m a web designer and illustrator located in Minneapolis, MN. I graduated MCAD with an MA in Graphic and Web Design in December 2023. I am passionate about creating accessible and visually appealing designs that bring ease to the everyday experience while also solving an issue or reaching a niche audience. I currently work as a web design intern at the Minnesota Historical Society. I enjoy delving deep into each phase of a project and developing fresh ideas in collaboration with others. Since graduation, I continue to build on what I learned through learning from colleagues and self-directed projects. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity for further training, such as continuing education courses, and the ability to visit inspiring designs in person.</p>
